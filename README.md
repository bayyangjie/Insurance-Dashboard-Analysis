# Insurance Dashboard Analysis
![Dashboard](https://github.com/bayyangjie/Insurance-Dashboard-Analysis/blob/main/images/dashboard_overall.png)

# Objective
The aim of this project is to identify the key factors that contributed to the losses experienced by the insurance company EIC. By analyzing various insurance-related metrics, the goal is to uncover insights that collectively explain the downturn in the companyâ€™s business performance. <br>

# Data Cleaning
Invalid values were identified in the table count of opened and closed policies. The invalid values were filtered to be excluded from the analysis. <br>

# Data Transformation

## DAX Measures

**Total Claims**:
Total amount of claims submitted.
```dax
Total Claims = SUM(policies[CLAIM_PAID])
```

<br>

**Average Premiums Paid by Clients**:
```dax
Avg.Premium = AVERAGE(policies[PREMIUM])
```

<br>

**Average Claim Amount of all opened policies**:
This calculates the average claim amount regardless whether a claim was submitted on the policy or not. 
```dax
Avg.Claim_All = DIVIDE([Total Claims],[Policies Opened])
```

<br>

**Claim Count**:
Total number of claims submitted. Policies where zero claims were made are excluded from the count.
```dax
Claim Count = CALCULATE([Policy Count], policies[CLAIM_PAID]>0)
```
<br>

**Total number of policies opened**:
Variables are created to count the number of total policies. The total number of opened policies is also equated to the total number of policies. 
```dax
Policy Count = COUNTROWS(policies)

Policies Opened = [Policy Count]
```
<br>

**Number of policies closed**:
USERELATIONSHIP(): Deactivates the relationship between 'DATE' key and 'INSR_BEGIN' key and activates the relationship between 'DATE' key and 'INSR_END' key to count the number of policies closed. The columns involved are those that define the activated relationship (i.e Policy Count, Date, INSR_END). <br>

The DAX measure below calculates the number of closed policies and using the insurance end dates as the filter context. USERRELATIONSHIP() activates the relationship between column 'Date' in 'Calendar' table and 'Date' column in 'Policies' table.
```dax
Policies Closed = CALCULATE([Policy Count], USERELATIONSHIP(policies[INSR_END],'calendar'[Date]))
```
<br>

**Bar Chart Labels**:
Multiple bar chart labels are combined and displayed on each bar. 

v_type: SELECTEDVALUE() is used to pull the name of the vehicle type from the column 'TYPE_VEHICLE' in the policies table. <br>

policies: Format the total number of opened policies for each type of vehicle <br>

p2c: Adds a red dot ðŸ”´ if the Premium-to-Claims ratio is below 1, or green âœ… otherwise. <br>

```dax
Bar Chart Labels = 
    var v_type = SELECTEDVALUE(policies[TYPE_VEHICLE])
    var policies = FORMAT([Policies Opened], "#,##0,.0k")
    var p2c = IF([Premium to Claims Ratio]<1,"ðŸ”´","âœ…")
return
    v_type & " " & policies & " " & p2c
```

<br>

**Creating context to tool tip labels**:
In the Premium vs Claim (Averages) scatter plot, the tooltip information was further enhanced by adding more information about what vehicle type and make each dot represents. 
The following DAX expression was used to display the vehicle type and make in addition to the information about the vehicle make's policy.
```dax
Tooltip Header = 
    var v_type = SELECTEDVALUE(policies[TYPE_VEHICLE])
    var v_make = SELECTEDVALUE(policies[MAKE])
return
    v_type & " - " & v_make
```
<br>

**Custom Tooltip Header**
A custom tool tip header was created by combining the "Vehicle Type" and "Make" string texts and display it on the tool tip when hovered over the dots in the scatterplot chart of "Premium vs Claim (Average)".
```dax
Tooltip Header = 
    var v_type = SELECTEDVALUE(policies[TYPE_VEHICLE])
    var v_make = SELECTEDVALUE(policies[MAKE])
return
    v_type & " - " & v_make
```

# Visualizations

## Average Premium vs Claims by Vehicle Type and Make (Scatterplot)
The average premiums and claims of each vehicle type and make are plotted on a scatterplot to determine whether majority of vehicles are generating losses (red) or profits (purple), and this can be viewed yearly using the 'Year' filter.

The tooltip information is enhanced to include more information about the number of policies opened for each vehicle type/make. That helps in further justifying whether policies should still be continued for a specific vehicle type/make coupled with the location of the scatter point in the chart. <br>

## Policy Claim count by Gender type
Gender Type "0" had opened the most policies as well as also having the most claims as compared to Gender Type "0" and "1". <br>

![Donut Chart](https://github.com/bayyangjie/Insurance-Dashboard-Analysis/blob/main/images/donut%20chart.png)

## Claim Amount by Usage Type
The ribbon chart shows the total claim amount of each usage type yearly from 2014 to 2018. It also shows how the rankings of the different usage segments change over the years. <br>

## Premium to Claim Ratio by Usage Type
The matrix chart shows the premium to claims ratio of the different usage types throughout the years from 2014 to 2018. The colours depict the ratios amount from high (red) to medium (orange/yellow) to low (green).
The chart shows that vehicles with the use type of General Cartage has the lowest overall premium to claim ratio. Given the job nature of land transportation of goods, it could be due to a higher rate of accidents resulting in higher claims being submitted for vehicles in this category. 

On the other hand, "Agricultural Own Farm" has the highest overall premium to claim ratio. This could be due to the low risk nature of the use case in agricultural farming thus resulting in lower claims being submitted.

The results from this plot also tallies with the ribbon chart where it shows "General Cartage" use as the highest ranking in total claim amount every year.

## Count of opened policies by Vehicle Type
The bar chart below shows the number of opened policies under each vehicle type and Motor-Cycles have the highest number followed by Trucks and Pick-ups. This could be due to businesses having these vehicles as the company vehicles thus having to get a vehicle insurance policy before purchasing one. In each bar, the green and red symbols represent premium-to-claim ratio of more than 1 and less than 1 respectively. <br>
